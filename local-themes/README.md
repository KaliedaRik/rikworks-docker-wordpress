Any changes to your theme's code or styling need to be added here. Copy the theme's folder to this folder so that you can work on changes locally and upload them to the wordpress docker volume when running docker-compose up command.

Code changes made via the CMS may be overwritten.

Content changes which get saved in the database should be safe.
